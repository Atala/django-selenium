Django Selenium Integration
========================

What is it?
===========
django-selenium is a toolset that provides seamless integration for Django_ framework with
a Selenium_ testing tool. It allows to write and execute **selenium tests** just as usual ones.

Dependencies
============
* Django_ 1.2 and above.
* Selenium_ 2.5.0 and above.

How do I use it?
================

1. Update ``settings.TEST_RUNNER = 'django_seleinum.test_runner.SeleniumTestRunner'``
   or subclass ``SeleniumTestRunner`` to make your own test runner with extended functionaliity.
2. Include selenium-specific settings in your own settings file.
   One setting that you must always define is ``SELENIUM_PATH``.
   It should point to the selenium-server.jar on your system, for example ``/home/dragoon/selenium-server-2.6.jar``
   See ``settings.py`` for other settings available.
3. Write some selenium tests for your apps in a module ``seltests.py``.
   Subclass selenium tests from ``django_seleinum.testcases.SeleniumTestCase``.
4. Add custom management command to override default test command::
       from django_selenium.management.commands import test_selenium

       class Command(test_selenium.Command):

           def handle(self, *test_labels, **options):
               super(Command, self).handle(*test_labels, **options)
   Place it somewhere in your app in ``management/commands/test.py``

5. Run ``manage.py test`` like you normally do. Now you have two extra options: ``--selenium`` and ``--selenium-only``.
   First runs selenium-specific tests after the usual ones, the last runs only selenium tests.

And that's it.
